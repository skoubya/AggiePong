# AggiePong

Main.html is curently unecessary

TO RUN:

In terminal: run `node server.js` in AggiePong folder

Open page "compute.cs.tamu.edu:10072" (or whatever port number you changed to in the server.js folder)


I ran the file in "aggiepong" using wamp server:  
1. install wamp, there are guides online  
2. run it (it should be a green "w" in the system tray)  
3. put the aggiepong folder for the game in the wamp/www directory  
4. type in: 127.0.0.1/aggiepong/part1.html into the URL bar  
  
If you find an easier way of running this, please let me know, thanks.
