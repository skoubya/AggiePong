# AggiePong

Main.html is curently unecessary

To get your changes to the .js files to affect the main file:

Host the files using this info: https://wiki.cse.tamu.edu/index.php/CSE_Web_Pages

Then change "http://students.cse.tamu.edu/skoubya/AggiePong/..." to  "http://students.cse.tamu.edu/<yourusername>/<yourpath>/..." in Main.html.

I ran the file in "aggiepong" using wamp server:  
1. install wamp, there are guides online  
2. run it (it should be a green "w" in the system tray)  
3. put the aggiepong folder for the game in the wamp/www directory  
4. type in: 127.0.0.1/aggiepong/part1.html into the URL bar  
  
If you find an easier way of running this, please let me know, thanks.
